# Parking-and-Camera-Violations

This project is part of my Database class. The requirement of the project was to create a database using data from the [New York State Open Source Data Website](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) about parking violations in the five boroughs of the state. And answer some questions regarding the database using SQL query.
